# HUMIDITY-AND-TEMPERATURE-MONITORING-USING-ARDUINO
Humidity and Temperature Monitoring using Arduino UNO to check and maintain the  humidity and temperature levels in the environment. Using Internet of Things (IOT), we can control any electronic equipment in homes and industries. Moreover, you can read a data from any sensor and analyse it graphically from anywhere in the world.Here, we can read temperature and humidity data from DHT11 sensor and upload it to a ThingSpeak cloud using Arduino Uno and ESP8266-01 module. Arduino Uno is MCU, it fetch a data of humidity and temperature from DHT11 sensor and Process it and give it to a ESP8266 Module.ESP8266 is a WiFi module, it is one of the leading platform for Internet of Things. It can transfer a data to IOT cloud.
